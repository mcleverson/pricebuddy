**Track prices from the stores you actually use. Run it yourself. Keep the data. Know when a deal is real.**

PriceBuddy is an open source, self-hostable price tracker for people who would rather watch products than browser tabs. Paste in a product URL, let PriceBuddy check it on a schedule, and get notified when the price or availability moves in your favour.

It works across different stores, keeps price history, compares listings, handles stock status, and can use your own AI provider when a page is awkward to scrape. The web app is the main control room; the API and CLI make it scriptable.

## Why PriceBuddy?

Most price trackers work only where someone has already built an integration. PriceBuddy is built for the messy web: normal product pages, changing markup, multiple listings for the same item, stores that go in and out of stock, and the usual "sale" prices that are not really sales.

Use it for everyday shopping, household wishlists, hobby gear, computer parts, baby stuff, subscriptions, marketplace listings, or anything else where timing matters.

## Features

### Track almost any store

Paste a product URL and PriceBuddy will try to read the product title, image, price and availability. Many stores work straight away. For trickier sites, you can tune the scrape strategy without changing code.

### Compare listings across retailers

Track the same product across multiple stores, or multiple listings on the same marketplace, and see the current best option in one place.

### Keep the price history

PriceBuddy records prices over time so you can see highs, lows and trends. That makes it easier to spot fake discounts and decide whether today's price is actually good.

### Get notified where you already are

Set a target price or percentage drop and let PriceBuddy watch for it. Notifications can go through the app, email, Pushover, Gotify, Apprise, Telegram, Discord or ntfy.

### Track availability, not just price

A cheap listing is useless if it is out of stock. PriceBuddy tracks in stock, pre-order, back order, special order, out of stock and discontinued states.

### Compare unit prices

PriceBuddy can calculate price per unit, so a 10-pack and a 3-pack can be compared fairly.

### Use AI only when it helps

Bring your own OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini or local Ollama provider. PriceBuddy can use AI to recover missing data from a page or help repair scraping rules. It is optional and off by default.

### Search for products to track

Connect a [SearXNG](https://github.com/searxng/searxng) instance and search for products from inside PriceBuddy.

### Organise a shared watchlist

Use tags, filters and multi-user accounts so each person can track their own products, targets and notification preferences.

### Discover deals with the Hermes agent

Create agent strategies in the admin panel to tell the Hermes discovery agent which store to browse, which niche (tags) to target, which starting URLs to visit, and the minimum discount to look for. Run a single strategy or all of them in sequence from the CLI.

### Host it yourself

Run PriceBuddy on your own server with Docker. Your watchlist, price history and notification settings stay under your control.

## PriceBuddy tools

PriceBuddy is designed to be useful from more than the web UI. The tool ecosystem is small for now, with more planned.

| Tool | What it is for |
| --- | --- |
| [PriceBuddy CLI](https://github.com/jez500/pricebuddy-cli) | Command-line access for humans and agents. Sync a local mirror, search products, inspect price history, run deal/drop reports, call the REST API, and expose PriceBuddy through MCP. |

A browser extension is planned.

## Installation

All you need is [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

Download [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml), adjust it for your environment, then start PriceBuddy:

```shell
touch .env
docker compose up -d
```

With the defaults, the app runs at `http://localhost:8080`.

Default login:

```text
admin@example.com / admin
```

Change that password immediately.

See the [installation guide](https://pricebuddy.jez.me/installation.html) for the full setup and configuration options.

> Docker is the recommended install path. If you want to run it another way, `docker/php.dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` are the best references for the required services and PHP extensions.

## Background tasks

The Docker image includes the scheduler needed for background work: checking prices, updating history and sending notifications. You do not need to run a separate cron container.

## Discovery agent (Hermes)

Hermes is an LLM-driven browser agent that explores configured stores and sends product candidates back to PriceBuddy. You control its behaviour through **Agent Strategies** in the admin panel under **Agent Strategy**.

Each strategy defines:

| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Store | Which store the agent should browse. |
| Niche (Tags) | Tags attached to any product the agent collects. |
| Visit URLs | Ordered list of pages the agent should start from. |
| Maximum products | Maximum candidates the agent should collect. |
| Minimum discount (%) | Minimum discount percentage for a candidate to be accepted. |

Run a strategy from the host:

```shell
php artisan buddy:agent-strategy-run <id>
```

Run all strategies in sequence:

```shell
php artisan buddy:agent-strategy-run --all
```

Preview what would be executed without running it:

```shell
php artisan buddy:agent-strategy-run <id> --dry-run
```

The command runs the Hermes container (`hermes_agent`) with the strategy values passed as environment variables and CLI arguments. Make sure Docker is available in the environment where you run the command.

## Settings and configuration

Most settings live in the app. Advanced options can be set in `.env`.

See the [settings docs](https://pricebuddy.jez.me/settings.html) for details.

## Affiliate codes

PriceBuddy adds affiliate codes for a [small number of stores](config/affiliates.php) to help support development.

If you do not want that, set this in `.env` or `docker-compose.yml`:

```env
AFFILIATE_ENABLED=false
```

If you disable affiliate support and still want to help, see [supporting the project](https://pricebuddy.jez.me/support-project.html).

## Inspiration

PriceBuddy was inspired by [Discount Bandit](https://github.com/Cybrarist/Discount-Bandit). PriceBuddy's main difference is flexibility: it aims to track products from arbitrary stores without requiring a code change for each retailer.

## Contributing and development

Contributions are welcome. Open an issue or pull request if you have a bug fix, store compatibility improvement, documentation change or feature idea.

PriceBuddy is built with [Laravel](https://laravel.com) and [Filament](https://filamentphp.com). Local development uses [Lando](https://lando.dev):

```shell
lando start
```

Coding standards, static analysis and tests are handled with Pint, PHPStan and Pest/PHPUnit. See the [development docs](https://pricebuddy.jez.me/advanced.html) for the full setup.
